# Virus Laboratory
Creating Computer Viruses for experimental use

This program was written by QuickBASIC.
VirusLaboratory designed for experimental purposes to demonstrate how computer viruses work.
The file extension of the viruses it produces is .ASM and these files are compiled via TASM and TLINK and produce the executable file of the virus with the com extension.
